# HHO-Based-Fused-Model-for-Locust-Detection
🔍 A deep learning–based object detection model for locust identification using a fused YOLOv5 + YOLOv8 ensemble. Proposed method Fuse the strengths of YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 to build a fast, reliable locust detector for real-world agricultural monitoring.

📌 Project Overview
This is the official repository for my research paper.

"Enhanced Locust Detection in Smart Farming Using YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 with Data Augmentation: A Comparative Performance Evaluation" with DOI 10.48084/etasr.11843 . This study aims to detect locusts in images using YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models. The dataset has been curated, annotated and augmentated specifically for this task.
This repository presents a comparative evaluation of YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for locust detection. The study was conducted on:

1️⃣ A curated dataset specifically prepared for locust detection.

2️⃣ An augmented version of the dataset, where various augmentation techniques were applied to enhance model robustness.

3️⃣ Labels are in YOLO format.

🔥 Key Findings:
◆ YOLOv8 outperformed YOLOv5 in both scenarios, achieving higher accuracy and better generalization.

◆ Dataset augmentation significantly improved model performance and provide higher F1 Score and better detection accuracy.

✅ Features
★ YOLOv5 & YOLOv8 implementations

★ Custom dataset (without augmentation and with augmentation) for locust detection

★ Training and inference scripts included

★ Supports Google Colab for easy execution
