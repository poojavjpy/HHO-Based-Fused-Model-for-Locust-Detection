# HHO-Based-Fused-Model-for-Locust-Detection
🔍 A deep learning–based object detection model for locust identification using a fused YOLOv5 + YOLOv8 ensemble. The proposed method employs Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO)–based fusion, leveraging the strengths of YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 to build a fast and reliable locust detector for real-world agricultural monitoring.

## 📌 Project Overview
This is the official repository for my research paper.

This study proposes an optimized fusion approach for locust detection in agricultural images using a combination of YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models. The fusion is performed through Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO), effectively leveraging the strengths of both architectures to achieve higher accuracy and robustness. The dataset has been carefully curated, annotated, and augmented for this specific task.
This repository presents the implementation and performance evaluation of the proposed HHO-based fused YOLOv5–YOLOv8 model for real-world locust identification in smart farming applications. The study was conducted on:

1️⃣ A curated dataset specifically prepared for locust detection.

2️⃣ An augmented version of the dataset, where various augmentation techniques were applied to enhance model robustness.

3️⃣ Labels are in YOLO format.

## 🔥 Key Findings:
◆ YOLOv8 outperformed YOLOv5 in both scenarios, achieving higher accuracy and better generalization.

◆ Dataset augmentation significantly improved model performance and provide higher F1 Score and better detection accuracy.
